1- main.py - The entry point of the FastAPI application.
This file initializes the FastAPI application and includes the routing for the API.

Code Explanation:
app = FastAPI(): Creates an instance of the FastAPI application.
models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine): Creates the database tables based on the SQLAlchemy models.
@app.post("/books/", response_model=schemas.Book): Defines a POST endpoint to create a new book.
@app.get("/books/", response_model=List[schemas.Book]): Defines a GET endpoint to retrieve a list of books.
def get_db(): Dependency that provides a database session to each route.

2- models.py - Contains the SQLAlchemy models that define the structure of the database tables.
This file defines the SQLAlchemy models for the database tables.

Code Explanation:
class Book(Base): Defines the Book model which extends Base (SQLAlchemy base class).
__tablename__: Specifies the name of the database table.
Column: Defines columns in the table with their types and constraints.

3- schemas.py - Defines Pydantic models for request and response validation.
This file defines Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.

Code Explanation:
class BookBase(BaseModel): Defines the base Pydantic model for book data.
class BookCreate(BookBase): Inherits from BookBase can be used to create new books.
class Book(BookBase): Extends BookBase to include the id field for responses.
class Config: Specifies that the Pydantic model should work with SQLAlchemy models.

4- crud.py - Contains functions for database operations (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete).
This file contains functions for performing CRUD operations on the database.

Code Explanation:
def create_book(db: Session, book: schemas.BookCreate): Creates a new book entry in the database.
def get_books(db: Session, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10): Retrieves a list of books from the database with pagination.

5- database.py - Contains the setup for the SQLAlchemy database connection.
This file sets up the SQLAlchemy database connection.
Code Explanation:
create_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL): Creates a SQLAlchemy engine connected to the database.
SessionLocal: A session maker to create new database sessions.
Base: The base class for all SQLAlchemy models.

Execute uvicorn app.main:app --reload to start the FastAPI server.
